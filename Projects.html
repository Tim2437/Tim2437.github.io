<h1>Projects</p>
<p>At OU there is a class you can take called Integrated Business Core where you and 14 other students create a company and sell a product together. Taking part in this class was one of my favorite experiences I've had at OU as I was able to maintain a position on the executive committee of the company. Along with IBC I'm currently working on a project in databases where we have to create a functioning database for a mock company. This includes mapping out the companies tables and ensuring that SQL statements can be executed.</p>
